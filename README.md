# Fuzzer Tool

This Fuzzer Tool is designed for **security testing** of web applications using a **fuzzing** technique to detect vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, and more.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install and run the **Fuzzer Tool**.

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
cd repo-name
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

This Fuzzer Tool is built using Python. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

Next, install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not available, ensure you install the necessary libraries, such as:

```bash
pip install requests
```

### 3. **Running the Fuzzer Tool**

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the fuzzer tool. Here's how you can run it:

#### **Example 1: Fuzzing a Parameter**

If the tool is meant to fuzz a specific parameter in a URL, run the script like this:

```bash
python fuzzer.py -u "https://example.com/vulnerable_page?param=value"
```

#### **Example 2: Running the Fuzzer with Payloads**

If the fuzzer requires a custom payload file for fuzzing the endpoint, you can do it like this:

```bash
python fuzzer.py -u "https://example.com/vulnerable_page" -p "payloads.txt"
```

### 4. **Input Format**

Make sure you use the correct input format when running the tool.

- **-u**: The target URL you want to test.
- **-p**: The payload file for fuzzing.

The payload file (`payloads.txt`) should contain a list of values that will be injected into the request parameters or body.

Example `payloads.txt`:

```
' OR 1=1--
<svg/onload=alert(1)>
...
```

### 5. **Viewing the Results**

Once the tool runs, the results will be displayed in the terminal/command prompt, showing whether any **vulnerabilities** were detected, such as SQL Injection, XSS, etc.
