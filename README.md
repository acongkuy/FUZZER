### 1. **Download ZIP!!!**

### 2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

Before installing dependencies, it's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies separately for this project.

#### **On Windows**:

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in the project directory.
2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

#### **On macOS/Linux**:

1. Open the terminal in the project directory.
2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

Once activated, you should see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt.

### 3. **Install Dependencies**

With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not available, you can install necessary libraries manually, for example:

```bash
pip install requests
```

### 4. **Run the Fuzzer Tool**

Now that the dependencies are installed, you can run the fuzzer tool.

#### **Example 1: Fuzzing a Parameter**

To fuzz a specific parameter in a URL:

```bash
python fuzzer.py -u "https://example.com/vulnerable_page?param=value"
```

#### **Example 2: Running the Fuzzer with Payloads**

To run the fuzzer with a custom payload file:

```bash
python fuzzer.py -u "https://example.com/vulnerable_page" -p "payloads.txt"
```

### 5. **Input Format**

Make sure you provide the correct format for the input when running the tool.

- **-u**: The target URL you want to test.
- **-p**: The payload file for fuzzing.

The payload file (`payloads.txt`) should contain a list of values to be injected into the request parameters or body.

Example `payloads.txt`:

```
' OR 1=1--
<svg/onload=alert(1)>
...
```

### 6. **Viewing the Results**

Once the tool is running, the results will appear in the terminal/command prompt, showing whether any **vulnerabilities** were detected, such as SQL Injection, XSS, etc.
